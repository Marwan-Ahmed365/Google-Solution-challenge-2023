Image Classification Problem

 We have used transfer learning concept in our model and we have chosed EfficientNetB3 pretrained model. 
 This pretrained model achieve 100% accuracy in training phase and 99% accuracy in both validation and testing phases with losses 0.1 in all of training, validation, and testing phases.
 This model has been fitted in just 15 epochs.

Image Segmentation Problem
 
 We have used U-Net Structure for solve this problem.
 We have used Dice coefficient and IoU coefficient as a metric for our model.
 This model achieve 90% in dice coefficient and 83.6 in iou coefficient in training phase and 89.6% in dice coefficient and 81.5 in iou coefficient in testing phase. 
 This model has been fitted in 120 epochs.
